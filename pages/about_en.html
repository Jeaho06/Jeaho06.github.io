        <h1>Cheating AI Omok: About the Game</h1>

        <h2>Game Concept</h2>
        <p>
            'Cheating AI Omok' was created for those who are tired of ordinary Omok games. The AI in this game goes beyond simply playing the best move; it uses cunning and unpredictable <strong>cheats</strong> in moments of crisis, just like a human might. Stand against the AI's unfair advantages and claim victory with your pure skill!
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The first player to get <strong>five</strong> of their stones in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. This is the same as standard Gomoku rules.
        </p>

        <h2>AI's Cheats Explained</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Veto:</strong> Once per game, when you are about to place a stone to complete a five-in-a-row and win, the AI can nullify that move and permanently seal the spot. This is the AI's last chance.</li>
            <li><strong>Place Bomb:</strong> On its turn, the AI can place a bomb instead of a stone. The bomb detonates on the AI's next turn, destroying all stones within a 3x3 area around it.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Move:</strong> The AI plays two moves consecutively in a single turn, used to quickly form an attack line or block your threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Swap Stone:</strong> To turn the tables, the AI swaps one of its own stones with the last stone you placed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Simple Strategy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Watch the description log:</strong> The AI explains why it makes a certain move. You can understand what the AI perceives as a threat through messages like 'to block an open three attack'.</li>
            <li><strong>Use cheats to your advantage:</strong> If you anticipate the AI will use 'Swap Stone', you can place your stone in a less critical position to reduce the cheat's effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>The 4-3 attack is still a winning strategy:</strong> No matter how much the AI cheats, if you create more than one attack route at once (like a 4-3 attack), the AI cannot block all threats and will be defeated.</li>
        </ul>
